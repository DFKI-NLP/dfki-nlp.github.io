Many current data drift detection methods only utilize input features to detect domain drift. While effective, these methods disregard the model’s evaluation of the data, which may be a significant source of information about the data domain. We propose to use information from the model in the form of explanations, specifically gradient times input, in order to utilize this information. Following the framework of Rabanser et al. [11], we combine these explanations with two-sample tests in order to detect a shift in distribution between training and evaluation data.

To address the gap between research and practice, we explore a set of state-of-the-art document representation methods for the task of retrieving semantically related US case law. We evaluate text-based (e.g., fastText, Transformers), citation-based (e.g., DeepWalk, Poincaré), and hybrid methods. We compare in total 27 methods using two silver standards with annotations for 2,964 documents. The silver standards are newly created from Open Case Book and Wikisource and can be reused under an open license facilitating reproducibility. Our experiments show that document representations from averaged fastText word vectors (trained on legal corpora) yield the best results, closely followed by Poincaré citation embeddings. Combining fastText and Poincaré in a hybrid manner further improves the overall result. Besides the overall performance, we analyze the methods depending on document length, citation count, and the coverage of their recommendations.

Thus, language understanding also requires continuous and efficient adaptation to new languages and domains, and transfer to, and between, both. Current language understanding technology, however, focuses on high resource languages and domains, uses little to no context, and assumes static data, task, and target distributions.

Occlusion is a well established method that provides explanations on discrete language data, e.g. by removing a language unit from an input and measuring the impact on a model's decision. We argue that current occlusion-based methods often produce invalid or syntactically incorrect language data, neglecting the improved abilities of recent NLP models. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation methods disregard the discrete distribution of data in NLP. Thus, we propose OLM: a novel explanation method that combines occlusion and language models to sample valid and syntactically correct replacements with high likelihood, given the context of the original input. We lay out a theoretical foundation that alleviates these weaknesses of other explanation methods in NLP and provide results that underline the importance of considering data likelihood in occlusion-based explanation.","tags":["Explainability"],"title":"Considering Likelihood in NLP Classification Explanations with Occlusion and Language Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Aleksandra Gabryszak","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594339200,"objectID":"8c459d2cf0ab9b1905c893ec91b8871c","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/acl2020-alt-probing/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acl2020-alt-probing/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the recent progress, little is known about the features captured by state-of-the-art neural relation extraction (RE) models. Common methods encode the source sentence, conditioned on the entity mentions, before classifying the relation. However, the complexity of the task makes it difficult to understand how encoder architecture and supporting linguistic knowledge affect the features learned by the encoder. We introduce 14 probing tasks targeting linguistic properties relevant to RE, and we use them to study representations learned by more than 40 different encoder architecture and linguistic feature combinations trained on two datasets, TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8. We find that the bias induced by the architecture and the inclusion of linguistic features are clearly expressed in the probing task performance. For example, adding contextualized word representations greatly increases performance on probing tasks with a focus on named entity and part-of-speech information, and yields better results in RE.

And how do crowd annotations, dataset, and models contribute to this error rate? To answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1. After validation, we analyze misclassifications on the challenging instances, categorize them into linguistically motivated error groups, and verify the resulting error hypotheses on three state-of-the-art RE models.

We make the source code and trained models of our experiments publicly available ","tags":[],"title":"Enriching BERT with Knowledge Graph Embedding for Document Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1558310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558310400,"objectID":"d6c8a5f82560901c80529e3d2c9e706a","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/akbc2019-alt-improving/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:10+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/akbc2019-alt-improving/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that transfer learning through generative language model pre-training improves supervised neural relation extraction, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Relation Extraction by Pre-Trained Language Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","Lisa Raithel","David Harbecke"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554224121,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554224121,"objectID":"2e97d4e5206e642fb4fe1c042c0171cc","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/nvc/","publishdate":"2019-04-02T17:55:21+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nvc/","section":"publication","summary":"Distributed word vector spaces are considered hard to interpret which hinders the understanding of natural language processing (NLP) models. In this work, we introduce a new method to interpret arbitrary samples from a word vector space. To this end, we train a neural model to conceptualize word vectors, which means that it activates higher order concepts it recognizes in a given vector. Contrary to prior approaches, our model operates in the original vector space and is capable of learning non-linear relations between word vectors and concepts. Furthermore, we show that it produces considerably less entropic concept activation profiles than the popular cosine similarity.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Vector Conceptualization for Word Vector Space Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","David Harbecke","Vivien Macketanz","Eleftherios Avramidis","Sebastian Möller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1553791245,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553791245,"objectID":"704fbe147dc60525fe2463f016efdd9d","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/diamat/","publishdate":"2019-03-28T17:40:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/diamat/","section":"publication","summary":"Evaluating translation models is a trade-off between effort and detail. On the one end of the spectrum there are automatic count-based methods such as BLEU, on the other end linguistic evaluations by humans, which arguably are more informative but also require a disproportionately high effort. To narrow the spectrum, we propose a general approach on how to automatically expose systematic differences between human and machine translations to human experts. Inspired by adversarial settings, we train a neural text classifier to distinguish human from machine translations. A classifier that performs and generalizes well after training should recognize systematic differences between the two classes, which we uncover with neural explainability methods. Our proof-of-concept implementation, DiaMaT, is open source. Applied to a dataset translated by a state-of-the-art neural Transformer model, DiaMaT achieves a classification accuracy of 75% and exposes meaningful differences between humans and the Transformer, amidst the current discussion about human parity.","tags":[],"title":"Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Roller","Christoph Alt","Laura Seiffe","He Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"433a17498e14b803ea57862a8b6aadd1","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:19+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"mEx - an Information Extraction Platform for German Medical Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Harbecke","Robert Schwarzenberg","Christoph Alt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"68f68d704af9c42e6dc03edd211ae360","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","section":"publication","summary":"PatternAttribution is a recent method, introduced in the vision domain, that explains classifications of deep neural networks.
