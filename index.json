Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) allow this projection, but existing explainability methods do not exploit this fact, i.e. do not focus their explanations on intermediate states. In this work, we present a novel method that traces and visualizes features that contribute to a classification decision in the visible and hidden layers of a GCN. Our method exposes hidden cross-layer dynamics in the input graph structure. We experimentally demonstrate that it yields meaningful layerwise explanations for a GCN sentence classifier.","tags":[],"title":"Layerwise Relevance Visualization in Convolutional Text Graph Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564358400,"objectID":"f4eb940c053dcbb0e51e8bc6f3c1280c","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/fine-tuning-pre-trained-transformer-language-models-to-distantly-supervised-relation-extraction/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:09:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fine-tuning-pre-trained-transformer-language-models-to-distantly-supervised-relation-extraction/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that generative language model pre-training combined with selective attention improves recall for long-tail relations in distantly supervised neural relation extraction.","tags":[],"title":"Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Transformer Language Models to Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1558310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558310400,"objectID":"ba406529ce40592af9b0e1d9b0ba770f","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/improving-relation-extraction-by-pre-trained-language-representations/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:10+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/improving-relation-extraction-by-pre-trained-language-representations/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that transfer learning through generative language model pre-training improves supervised neural relation extraction, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Relation Extraction by Pre-Trained Language Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","Lisa Raithel","David Harbecke"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554224121,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554224121,"objectID":"2e97d4e5206e642fb4fe1c042c0171cc","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/nvc/","publishdate":"2019-04-02T17:55:21+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nvc/","section":"publication","summary":"Distributed word vector spaces are considered hard to interpret which hinders the understanding of natural language processing (NLP) models. In this work, we introduce a new method to interpret arbitrary samples from a word vector space. To this end, we train a neural model to conceptualize word vectors, which means that it activates higher order concepts it recognizes in a given vector. Contrary to prior approaches, our model operates in the original vector space and is capable of learning non-linear relations between word vectors and concepts. Furthermore, we show that it produces considerably less entropic concept activation profiles than the popular cosine similarity.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Vector Conceptualization for Word Vector Space Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","David Harbecke","Vivien Macketanz","Eleftherios Avramidis","Sebastian Möller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1553791245,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553791245,"objectID":"704fbe147dc60525fe2463f016efdd9d","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/diamat/","publishdate":"2019-03-28T17:40:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/diamat/","section":"publication","summary":"Evaluating translation models is a trade-off between effort and detail. On the one end of the spectrum there are automatic count-based methods such as BLEU, on the other end linguistic evaluations by humans, which arguably are more informative but also require a disproportionately high effort. To narrow the spectrum, we propose a general approach on how to automatically expose systematic differences between human and machine translations to human experts. Inspired by adversarial settings, we train a neural text classifier to distinguish human from machine translations. A classifier that performs and generalizes well after training should recognize systematic differences between the two classes, which we uncover with neural explainability methods. Our proof-of-concept implementation, DiaMaT, is open source. Applied to a dataset translated by a state-of-the-art neural Transformer model, DiaMaT achieves a classification accuracy of 75% and exposes meaningful differences between humans and the Transformer, amidst the current discussion about human parity.","tags":[],"title":"Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Roller","Christoph Alt","Laura Seiffe","He Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"433a17498e14b803ea57862a8b6aadd1","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:19+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"mEx - an Information Extraction Platform for German Medical Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Harbecke","Robert Schwarzenberg","Christoph Alt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"68f68d704af9c42e6dc03edd211ae360","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","section":"publication","summary":"PatternAttribution is a recent method, introduced in the vision domain, that explains classifications of deep neural networks.
