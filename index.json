They are difficult to interpret for laypeople, especially for instances with many features. In order to make them more accessible, we formalize the underexplored task of translating saliency maps into natural language and compare methods that address two key challenges of this approach -- what and how to verbalize. In both automatic and human evaluation setups, using token-level attributions from text classification tasks, we compare two novel methods (search-based and instruction-based verbalizations) against conventional feature importance representations (heatmap visualizations and extractive rationales), measuring simulatability, faithfulness, helpfulness and ease of understanding. Instructing GPT-3.5 to generate saliency map verbalizations yields plausible explanations which include associations, abstractive summarization and commonsense reasoning, achieving by far the highest human ratings, but they are not faithfully capturing numeric information and are inconsistent in their interpretation of the task. In comparison, our search-based, model-free verbalization approach efficiently completes templated verbalizations, is faithful by design, but falls short in helpfulness and simulatability. Our results suggest that saliency map verbalization makes feature attribution explanations more comprehensible and less cognitively challenging to humans than conventional representations.","tags":["Interpretability"],"title":"Saliency Map Verbalization: Comparing Feature Importance Representations from Model-free and Instruction-based Methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684886400,"objectID":"cabf17b70c41b00d24ce53389c9df8a5","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/dataset/multitacred/","publishdate":"2023-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/dataset/multitacred/","section":"dataset","summary":"MultiTACRED is a multilingual version of the large-scale [TAC Relation Extraction Dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/tacred).

As the model sizes grow, the performance gap between English and other languages with fewer compute and data resources increases even further. Consequently, more resource-efficient training methods are needed to bridge the gap for languages with fewer resources available. To address this problem, we introduce a cross-lingual and progressive transfer learning approach, called CLP-Transfer, that transfers models from a source language, for which pretrained models are publicly available, like English, to a new target language. As opposed to prior work, which focused on the cross-lingual transfer between two languages, we extend the transfer to the model size. Given a pretrained model in a source language, we aim for a same-sized model in a target language. Instead of training a model from scratch, we exploit a smaller model that is in the target language but requires much fewer resources. Both small and source models are then used to initialize the token embeddings of the larger model based on the overlapping vocabulary of the source and target language. All remaining weights are reused from the model in the source language. This approach outperforms the sole cross-lingual transfer and can save up to 80% of the training steps compared to the random initialization.

We analyze translation and annotation projection quality, identify error categories, and experimentally evaluate fine-tuned pretrained mono- and multilingual language models in common transfer learning scenarios. Our analyses show that machine translation is a viable strategy to transfer RE instances, with native speakers judging more than 83% of the translated instances to be linguistically and semantically acceptable. We find monolingual RE model performance to be comparable to the English original for many of the target languages, and that multilingual models trained on a combination of English and target language data can outperform their monolingual counterparts. However, we also observe a variety of translation and annotation projection errors, both due to the MT systems and linguistic features of the target languages, such as pronoun-dropping, compounding and inflection, that degrade dataset quality and RE model performance.","tags":[],"title":"MultiTACRED: A Multilingual Version of the TAC Relation Extraction Dataset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akhila Abdulnazar","Markus Kreuzthaler","Roland Roller","Stefan Schulz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1683534783,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683534783,"objectID":"50063dc2283e29f4dcc33d54d6467958","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/shti2023-abdulnazar-sapbert/","publishdate":"2023-05-08T10:33:03+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/shti2023-abdulnazar-sapbert/","section":"publication","summary":"Word vector representations, known as embeddings, are commonly used for natural language processing.

Consequently, illegal markets and their connections are challenging to uncover on the Darknet. To identify relationships between illegal markets and their vendors, we propose VendorLink, an NLP-based approach that examines writing patterns to verify, identify, and link unique vendor accounts across text advertisements (ads) on seven public Darknet markets. In contrast to existing literature, VendorLink utilizes the strength of supervised pretraining to perform closed-set vendor verification, open-set vendor identification, and low-resource market adaption tasks. Through VendorLink, we uncover (i) 15 migrants and 71 potential aliases in the Alphabay-Dreams-Silk dataset, (ii) 17 migrants and 3 potential aliases in the Valhalla-Berlusconi dataset, and (iii) 75 migrants and 10 potential aliases in the Traderoute-Agora dataset.

However, beyond often short-lived improvements, many additional aspects need to be taken into consideration to make sustainable progress. What does it take to implement a clinical decision support system, what makes it usable for the domain experts, and what brings it eventually into practical usage? So far, there has been little research to answer these questions. This work presents a multidisciplinary view of machine learning in medical decision support systems and covers information technology, medical, as well as ethical aspects. The target audience is computer scientists, who plan to do research in a clinical context. The paper starts from a relatively straightforward risk prediction system in the subspecialty nephrology that was evaluated on historic patient data both intrinsically and based on a reader study with medical doctors. Although the results were quite promising, the focus of this article is not on the model itself or potential performance improvements. Instead, we want to let other researchers participate in the lessons we have learned and the insights we have gained when implementing and evaluating our system in a clinical setting within a highly interdisciplinary pilot project in the cooperation of computer scientists, medical doctors, ethicists, and legal experts.","tags":[],"title":"When performance is not enough—A multidisciplinary view on clinical decision support","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Castle","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1680344191,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680344191,"objectID":"55ec654e3395f87ccf3f3d9f6afb8417","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/project/data4transparency/","publishdate":"2023-04-01T11:16:31+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/data4transparency/","section":"project","summary":"According to the World Bank and the UN, some US$1tn is paid in bribes every year.

In general, detecting health-related tweets is notoriously challenging for natural language processing tools. The main challenge, aside from the informality of the language used, is that people tweet about any and all topics, and most of their tweets are not related to health. Thus, finding those tweets in a user’s timeline that mention specific health-related concepts such as medications requires addressing extreme imbalance. Task 3 called for detecting tweets in a user’s timeline that mentions a medication name and, for each detected mention, extracting its span. The organizers made available a corpus consisting of 182 049 tweets publicly posted by 212 Twitter users with all medication mentions manually annotated. The corpus exhibits the natural distribution of positive tweets, with only 442 tweets (0.2\\%) mentioning a medication. This task was an opportunity for participants to evaluate methods that are robust to class imbalance beyond the simple lexical match. A total of 65 teams registered, and 16 teams submitted a system run. This study summarizes the corpus created by the organizers and the approaches taken by the participating teams for this challenge.

Methods: The basis for this study is a qualitative content analysis of expert interviews with experienced nephrologists after testing an AI-DSS in a straightforward usage scenario. Results: The results provide insights on the basics of clinical decision-making, expected challenges when using AI-DSS as well as a reflection on the test run. Discussion: While we can confirm the somewhat expectable demand for better explainability and control, other insights highlight the need to uphold classical strengths of the medical profession when using AI-DSS as well as the importance of broadening the view of AI-related challenges to the clinical environment, especially during treatment. Our results stress the necessity for adjusting AI-DSS to shared decision-making.

Many machine learning models have been developed for detecting patient outcomes in the past years. However, performance metrics alone do not determine practical utility. We present a newly developed clinical decision support system (CDSS) for detection of patients at risk for rejection and death-censored graft failure. The CDSS is based on clinical routine data including 1,516 kidney transplant recipients and more than 100,000 data points. In a reader study we compare the performance of physicians at a nephrology department with and without the CDSS. Internal validation shows AUC-ROC scores of 0.83 for rejection, and 0.95 for graft failure. The reader study shows that predictions by physicians converge toward the CDSS. However, performance does not improve (AUC–ROC; 0.6413 vs. 0.6314 for rejection; 0.8072 vs. 0.7778 for graft failure). Finally, the study shows that the CDSS detects partially different patients at risk compared to physicians. This indicates that the combination of both, medical professionals and a CDSS might help detect more patients at risk for graft failure. However, the question of how to integrate such a system efficiently into clinical practice remains open.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation of a clinical decision support system for detection of patients at risk after kidney transplantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuxuan Chen","David Harbecke","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1666427583,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666427583,"objectID":"4c041d8a26606010a045082e8f180e45","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/emnlp2022-chen-meffiprompt/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T10:33:03+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/emnlp2022-chen-meffiprompt/","section":"publication","summary":"Prompting pre-trained language models has achieved impressive performance on various NLP tasks, especially in low data regimes.

In this paper, we present the first work on prompt-based multilingual relation classification (RC), by introducing an efficient and effective method that constructs prompts from relation triples and involves only minimal translation for the class labels. We evaluate its performance in fully supervised, few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, and analyze its effectiveness across 14 languages, prompt variants, and English-task training in cross-lingual settings. We find that in both fully supervised and few-shot scenarios, our prompt method beats competitive baselines: fine-tuning XLM-R-EM and null prompts.

In this work, we introduce a sequential pipeline model combining ADUR and ARE for full-text SAM, and provide a first analysis of the performance of pretrained language models (PLMs) on both subtasks. We establish a new SotA for ADUR on the Sci-Arg corpus, outperforming the previous best reported result by a large margin (+7% F1).

Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cut-off to similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning, and ignores that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation - a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can train (or tune) models sample-efficiently, and that it can be combined with recent training-efficient methods. Perhaps surprisingly, even training a general-domain language model this way outperforms baselines pretrained in-domain.

In order to introduce such applications into clinical practice, a good performance might be essential, however, the aspect of trust should not be underestimated. For the treating physician using such a system and being (legally) responsible for the decision made, it is particularly important to understand the system’s recommendation. To provide insights into a model’s decision, various techniques from the field of explainability (XAI) have been proposed whose output is often enough not targeted to the domain experts that want to use the model. To close this gap, in this work, we explore how explanations could possibly look like in future. To this end, this work presents a dataset of textual explanations in context of decision support. Within a reader study, human physicians estimated the likelihood of possible negative patient outcomes in the near future and justified each decision with a few sentences. Using those sentences, we created a novel corpus, annotated with different semantic layers.

The data consists of 4,169 binary annotated documents from a German patient forum, where users talk about health issues and get advice from medical doctors. As is common in social media data in this domain, the class labels of the corpus are very imbalanced. This and a high topic imbalance make it a very challenging dataset, since often, the same symptom can have several causes and is not always related to a medication intake. We aim to encourage further multi-lingual efforts in the domain of ADR detection and provide preliminary experiments for binary classification using different methods of zero- and few-shot learning based on a multi-lingual model. When fine-tuning XLM-RoBERTa first on English patient forum data and then on the new German data, we achieve an F1-score of 37.52 for the positive class.

We investigate an automated approach to extract legal claims from news articles and to match the claims with their corresponding applicable laws. We examine the feasibility of the two tasks concerning claims about COVID-19-related laws from Berlin, Germany. For both tasks, we create and make publicly available the data sets and report the results of initial experiments. We obtain promising results with Transformer-based models that achieve 46.7 F1 for claim extraction and 91.4 F1 for law matching, albeit with some conceptual limitations.

However, similarity computed on single vector representations provides only one perspective on document similarity that ignores which aspects make two documents alike. To address this limitation, aspect-based similarity measures have been developed using document segmentation or pairwise multi-class document classification. While segmentation harms the document coherence, the pairwise classification approach scales poorly to large scale corpora. In this paper, we treat aspect-based similarity as a classical vector similarity problem in aspect-specific embedding spaces. We represent a document not as a single generic embedding but as multiple specialized embeddings. Our approach avoids document segmentation and scales linearly w.r.t. the corpus size. In an empirical study, we use the Papers with Code corpus containing 157, 606 research papers and consider the task, method, and dataset of the respective research papers as their aspects. We compare and analyze three generic document embeddings, six specialized document embeddings and a pairwise classification baseline in the context of research paper recommendations. As generic document embeddings, we consider FastText, SciBERT, and SPECTER. To compute the specialized document embeddings, we compare three alternative methods inspired by retrofitting, fine-tuning, and Siamese networks. In our experiments, Siamese SciBERT achieved the highest scores. Additional analyses indicate an implicit bias of the generic document embeddings towards the dataset aspect and against the method aspect of each research paper. Our approach of aspect-based document embeddings mitigates potential risks arising from implicit biases by making them explicit. This can, for example, be used for more diverse and explainable recommendations.","tags":[],"title":"Specialized Document Embeddings for Aspect-based Similarity of Research Papers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qian Ruan","Malte Ostendorff","Georg Rehm"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1657092324,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657092324,"objectID":"6e990907eaa367fdde36268f7946a4be","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/acl2022-ruan/","publishdate":"2022-07-06T09:25:24+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acl2022-ruan/","section":"publication","summary":"Transformer-based language models usually treat texts as linear sequences.

Using various experimental settings on three datasets (i.e., CNN/DailyMail, PubMed and arXiv), our HiStruct+ model outperforms a strong baseline collectively, which differs from our model only in that the hierarchical structure information is not injected. It is also observed that the more conspicuous hierarchical structure the dataset has, the larger improvements our method gains.

Despite its importance for the profession, legal applications do not reflect the latest advances in recommender systems and representation learning research. Simultaneously, legal recommender systems are typically evaluated in small-scale user study without any public available benchmark datasets. Thus, these studies have limited reproducibility. To address the gap between research and practice, we explore a set of state-of-the-art document representation methods for the task of retrieving semantically related US case law. We evaluate text-based (e.g., fastText, Transformers), citation-based (e.g., DeepWalk, Poincaré), and hybrid methods. We compare in total 27 methods using two silver standards with annotations for 2,964 documents. The silver standards are newly created from Open Case Book and Wikisource and can be reused under an open license facilitating reproducibility. Our experiments show that document representations from averaged fastText word vectors (trained on legal corpora) yield the best results, closely followed by Poincaré citation embeddings. Combining fastText and Poincaré in a hybrid manner further improves the overall result. Besides the overall performance, we analyze the methods depending on document length, citation count, and the coverage of their recommendations.

We perform our experiments on a newly proposed dataset of 32,168 Wikipedia article pairs and Wikidata properties that define the semantic document relations.

Occlusion is a well established method that provides explanations on discrete language data, e.g. by removing a language unit from an input and measuring the impact on a model's decision. We argue that current occlusion-based methods often produce invalid or syntactically incorrect language data, neglecting the improved abilities of recent NLP models. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation methods disregard the discrete distribution of data in NLP. Thus, we propose OLM: a novel explanation method that combines occlusion and language models to sample valid and syntactically correct replacements with high likelihood, given the context of the original input.

We introduce 14 probing tasks targeting linguistic properties relevant to RE, and we use them to study representations learned by more than 40 different encoder architecture and linguistic feature combinations trained on two datasets, TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8. We find that the bias induced by the architecture and the inclusion of linguistic features are clearly expressed in the probing task performance.

To answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1. After validation, we analyze misclassifications on the challenging instances, categorize them into linguistically motivated error groups, and verify the resulting error hypotheses on three state-of-the-art RE models.

For NVC, a neural model activates higher order concepts it recognizes in a word vector instance. To this end, the model first needs to be trained with a sufficiently large instance-to-concept ground truth, which only exists for a few languages. In this work, we tackle this lack of resources with word vector space alignment techniques: We train the NVC model on a high resource language and test it with vectors from an aligned word vector space of another language, without retraining or fine-tuning. A quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the NVC model indeed activates meaningful concepts for unseen vectors from the aligned vector space. NVC thus becomes available for low resource languages for which no appropriate concept ground truth exists.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-lingual Neural Vector Conceptualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","Marc Hübner","David Harbecke","Christoph Alt","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569476323,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569476323,"objectID":"a473d0f5238b0e0755c80265a795c54a","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/layerwise-relevance-visualization-in-convolutional-text-graph-classifiers/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T07:38:43+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/layerwise-relevance-visualization-in-convolutional-text-graph-classifiers/","section":"publication","summary":"Representations in the hidden layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are often hard to interpret since it is difficult to project them into an interpretable domain.

On the one end of the spectrum there are automatic count-based methods such as BLEU, on the other end linguistic evaluations by humans, which arguably are more informative but also require a disproportionately high effort. To narrow the spectrum, we propose a general approach on how to automatically expose systematic differences between human and machine translations to human experts. Inspired by adversarial settings, we train a neural text classifier to distinguish human from machine translations. A classifier that performs and generalizes well after training should recognize systematic differences between the two classes, which we uncover with neural explainability methods. Our proof-of-concept implementation, DiaMaT, is open source. Applied to a dataset translated by a state-of-the-art neural Transformer model, DiaMaT achieves a classification accuracy of 75% and exposes meaningful differences between humans and the Transformer, amidst the current discussion about human parity.","tags":[],"title":"Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Roller","Christoph Alt","Laura Seiffe","He Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"433a17498e14b803ea57862a8b6aadd1","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:19+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"mEx - an Information Extraction Platform for German Medical Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Harbecke","Robert Schwarzenberg","Christoph Alt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"68f68d704af9c42e6dc03edd211ae360","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","section":"publication","summary":"PatternAttribution is a recent method, introduced in the vision domain, that explains classifications of deep neural networks.
