Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) allow this projection, but existing explainability methods do not exploit this fact, i.e. do not focus their explanations on intermediate states. In this work, we present a novel method that traces and visualizes features that contribute to a classification decision in the visible and hidden layers of a GCN. Our method exposes hidden cross-layer dynamics in the input graph structure. We experimentally demonstrate that it yields meaningful layerwise explanations for a GCN sentence classifier.","tags":[],"title":"Layerwise Relevance Visualization in Convolutional Text Graph Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564358400,"objectID":"0663122e3f3d9a0b085257fc638111fd","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/publication/fine-tuning-pre-trained-transformer-language-models-to-distantly-supervised-relation-extraction/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:09:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/publication/fine-tuning-pre-trained-transformer-language-models-to-distantly-supervised-relation-extraction/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that generative language model pre-training combined with selective attention improves recall for long-tail relations in distantly supervised neural relation extraction.","tags":[],"title":"Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Transformer Language Models to Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1558310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558310400,"objectID":"c8d554603755377310218e59ce103813","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/publication/improving-relation-extraction-by-pre-trained-language-representations/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:10+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/publication/improving-relation-extraction-by-pre-trained-language-representations/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that transfer learning through generative language model pre-training improves supervised neural relation extraction, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Relation Extraction by Pre-Trained Language Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Roller","Christoph Alt","Laura Seiffe","He Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"5aff4230610cd57020791b63fec23355","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:19+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/publication/mex-an-information-extraction-platform-for-german-medical-text/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"mEx - an Information Extraction Platform for German Medical Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Harbecke","Robert Schwarzenberg","Christoph Alt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"a98b1782272b6533eeb5cbd1531a020d","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/publication/learning-explanations-from-language-data/","section":"publication","summary":"PatternAttribution is a recent method, introduced in the vision domain, that explains classifications of deep neural networks.
