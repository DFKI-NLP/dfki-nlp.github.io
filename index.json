Filling this information gap requires contextual inference, background- and commonsense knowledge, and reasoning over situational context.

Thus, language understanding also requires continuous and efficient adaptation to new languages and domains, and transfer to, and between, both. Current language understanding technology, however, focuses on high resource languages and domains, uses little to no context, and assumes static data, task, and target distributions.

Occlusion is a well established method that provides explanations on discrete language data, e.g. by removing a language unit from an input and measuring the impact on a model's decision. We argue that current occlusion-based methods often produce invalid or syntactically incorrect language data, neglecting the improved abilities of recent NLP models. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation methods disregard the discrete distribution of data in NLP. Thus, we propose OLM: a novel explanation method that combines occlusion and language models to sample valid and syntactically correct replacements with high likelihood, given the context of the original input. We lay out a theoretical foundation that alleviates these weaknesses of other explanation methods in NLP and provide results that underline the importance of considering data likelihood in occlusion-based explanation.","tags":["Explainability"],"title":"Considering Likelihood in NLP Classification Explanations with Occlusion and Language Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Aleksandra Gabryszak","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594339200,"objectID":"8c459d2cf0ab9b1905c893ec91b8871c","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/acl2020-alt-probing/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acl2020-alt-probing/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the recent progress, little is known about the features captured by state-of-the-art neural relation extraction (RE) models. Common methods encode the source sentence, conditioned on the entity mentions, before classifying the relation. However, the complexity of the task makes it difficult to understand how encoder architecture and supporting linguistic knowledge affect the features learned by the encoder. We introduce 14 probing tasks targeting linguistic properties relevant to RE, and we use them to study representations learned by more than 40 different encoder architecture and linguistic feature combinations trained on two datasets, TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8. We find that the bias induced by the architecture and the inclusion of linguistic features are clearly expressed in the probing task performance. For example, adding contextualized word representations greatly increases performance on probing tasks with a focus on named entity and part-of-speech information, and yields better results in RE. In contrast, entity masking improves RE, but considerably lowers performance on entity type related probing tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Probing Linguistic Features of Sentence-Level Representations in Neural Relation Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Aleksandra Gabryszak","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594339200,"objectID":"4b6a4a0f754ff65730e25ac13406e529","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/acl2020-alt-tacred-revisited/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acl2020-alt-tacred-revisited/","section":"publication","summary":"TACRED is one of the largest, most widely used crowdsourced datasets in Relation Extraction (RE).

In this paper, we investigate the questions: Have we reached a performance ceiling or is there still room for improvement? And how do crowd annotations, dataset, and models contribute to this error rate? To answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1. After validation, we analyze misclassifications on the challenging instances, categorize them into linguistically motivated error groups, and verify the resulting error hypotheses on three state-of-the-art RE models. We show that two groups of ambiguous relations are responsible for most of the remaining errors and that models may adopt shallow heuristics on the dataset when entities are not masked.","tags":[],"title":"TACRED Revisited: A Thorough Evaluation of the TACRED Relation Extraction Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"ed06710d923aeb8f0220aefc368307e9","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/dataset/dfki-daystream-corpus/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/dataset/dfki-daystream-corpus/","section":"dataset","summary":"The Daystream corpus is a dataset of 3541 German-language documents that have been annotated with fine-grained geo-entities, such as streets, stops and routes, as well as standard named entity types (organization, date, number, etc).

For NVC, a neural model activates higher order concepts it recognizes in a word vector instance. To this end, the model first needs to be trained with a sufficiently large instance-to-concept ground truth, which only exists for a few languages. In this work, we tackle this lack of resources with word vector space alignment techniques: We train the NVC model on a high resource language and test it with vectors from an aligned word vector space of another language, without retraining or fine-tuning. A quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the NVC model indeed activates meaningful concepts for unseen vectors from the aligned vector space. NVC thus becomes available for low resource languages for which no appropriate concept ground truth exists.","tags":[],"title":"Cross-lingual Neural Vector Conceptualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","Marc Hübner","David Harbecke","Christoph Alt","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569476323,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569476323,"objectID":"a473d0f5238b0e0755c80265a795c54a","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/layerwise-relevance-visualization-in-convolutional-text-graph-classifiers/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T07:38:43+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/layerwise-relevance-visualization-in-convolutional-text-graph-classifiers/","section":"publication","summary":"Representations in the hidden layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are often hard to interpret since it is difficult to project them into an interpretable domain. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) allow this projection, but existing explainability methods do not exploit this fact, i.e. do not focus their explanations on intermediate states. In this work, we present a novel method that traces and visualizes features that contribute to a classification decision in the visible and hidden layers of a GCN. Our method exposes hidden cross-layer dynamics in the input graph structure. We experimentally demonstrate that it yields meaningful layerwise explanations for a GCN sentence classifier.","tags":[],"title":"Layerwise Relevance Visualization in Convolutional Text Graph Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564358400,"objectID":"584cb9534c1efd44745dff10b6121dc1","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/acl2019-alt-finetuning/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:09:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acl2019-alt-finetuning/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that generative language model pre-training combined with selective attention improves recall for long-tail relations in distantly supervised neural relation extraction.","tags":[],"title":"Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Transformer Language Models to Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1558310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558310400,"objectID":"d6c8a5f82560901c80529e3d2c9e706a","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/akbc2019-alt-improving/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:10+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/akbc2019-alt-improving/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that transfer learning through generative language model pre-training improves supervised neural relation extraction, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Relation Extraction by Pre-Trained Language Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","Lisa Raithel","David Harbecke"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554224121,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554224121,"objectID":"2e97d4e5206e642fb4fe1c042c0171cc","permalink":"https://dfki-nlp.github.io/publication/nvc/","publishdate":"2019-04-02T17:55:21+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nvc/","section":"publication","summary":"Distributed word vector spaces are considered hard to interpret which hinders the understanding of natural language processing (NLP) models.

On the one end of the spectrum there are automatic count-based methods such as BLEU, on the other end linguistic evaluations by humans, which arguably are more informative but also require a disproportionately high effort. To narrow the spectrum, we propose a general approach on how to automatically expose systematic differences between human and machine translations to human experts. Inspired by adversarial settings, we train a neural text classifier to distinguish human from machine translations. A classifier that performs and generalizes well after training should recognize systematic differences between the two classes, which we uncover with neural explainability methods. Our proof-of-concept implementation, DiaMaT, is open source. Applied to a dataset translated by a state-of-the-art neural Transformer model, DiaMaT achieves a classification accuracy of 75% and exposes meaningful differences between humans and the Transformer, amidst the current discussion about human parity.","tags":[],"title":"Train, Sort, Explain: Learning to Diagnose Translation Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
