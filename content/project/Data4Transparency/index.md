title: "Data4Transparency"
summary: "According to the World Bank and the UN, some US$1tn is paid in bribes every year. Corrupt financial transactions divert funds from legitimate public services, as well as distort free markets—potentially thwarting economic development—and reduce trust in institutions. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a global platform for investigative reporting, providing resources to journalists and media centres, enabling cost-effective collaboration between editors and offering tools to secure themselves against threats to independent media. Exposing previously-unknown connections between entities makes it possible for citizens, policymakers, activists and law enforcement agencies to act. As the number of such leaks and publications grows, there is an increasing need for effective, scalable and reproducible methods to discover any anomalies and evidence of malfeasance that might exist within them."
