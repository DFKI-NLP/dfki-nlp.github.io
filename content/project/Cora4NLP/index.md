title: "Cora4NLP"
summary: "Language is implicit - it omits information. Filling this information gap requires contextual inference, background- and commonsense knowledge, and reasoning over situational context. Language also evolves, i.e., it specializes and changes over time. For example, many different languages and domains exist, new domains arise, and both evolve constantly. Thus, language understanding also requires continuous and efficient adaptation to new languages and domains, and transfer to, and between, both. Current language understanding technology, however, focuses on high resource languages and domains, uses little to no context, and assumes static data, task, and target distributions. The research in Cora4NLP aims to address these challenges. It builds on the expertise and results of the predecessor project DEEPLEE and is carried out jointly between the language technology research departments in Berlin and Saarbr√ºcken. "
