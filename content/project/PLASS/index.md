title: "PLASS"
summary: "The aim of the PLASS project is to develop a prototypical B2B platform for AI-based decision support for supply chain management. The focus is on the automatic recognition of decision-relevant information and the acquisition of structured knowledge from global and multilingual text sources. These sources provide a large database for SCM information, especially for the early detection of critical events and risks, but also of opportunities, e.g. through new technologies, at suppliers and supply chains. PLASS enables SMEs and large companies to continuously monitor their suppliers and supply chains, and supports supply chain managers in risk assessment and decision-making."
