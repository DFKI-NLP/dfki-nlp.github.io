title: "BIFOLD"
summary: "BIFOLD conducts foundational research in big data management and machine learning, as well as its intersection, to educate future talent, and create high-impact knowledge exchange. The Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data (BIFOLD), has evolved in 2019 from the merger of two national Artificial Intelligence Competence Centers: the Berlin Big Data Center (BBDC) and the Berlin Center for Machine Learning (BZML). Embedded in the vibrant Berlin metropolitan area, BIFOLD provides an outstanding scientific environment and numerous collaboration opportunities for national and international researchers. BIFOLD offers a broad range of research topics as well as a platform for interdisciplinary research and knowledge exchange with the sciences and humanities, industry, startups and society. Within BIFOLD, DFKI SLT conducts research in Clinical AI, specifically addressing the task of Pharmacovigilance. Pharmacovigilance is concerned with the assessment and prevention of adverse drug reactions (ADR) in pharmaceutical products. As the level of medication is generally raising all over the world, the potential risk of unwanted side effects, such as ADRs, is constantly increasing. Patients exchange views in their own language as 'experts in their own right,' in social media and disease-specific forums. Our project addresses the detection and extraction of ADR from medical forums and social media across different languages using cross-lingual transfer learning in combination with external knowledge sources."
