title: MobASA Corpus
summary: "This repository contains corpus called MobASA: a novel German-language corpus of tweets annotated with their relevance for public transportation, and with sentiment towards aspects related to barrier-free travel. We identified and labeled topics important for passengers limited in their mobility due to disability, age, or when travelling with young children.

The data can be used for as a training or test corpus for aspect-oriented sentiment analysis. Moreover, the corpus can benefit building inclusive public transportation systems. You can find the corpus here: https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/sim3s-corpus, and the description of the corpus here: https://aclanthology.org/2022.csrnlp-1.5.pdf"
