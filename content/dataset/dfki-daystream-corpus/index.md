title: Daystream Corpus
summary: "The Daystream corpus is a dataset of 3541 German-language documents that have been annotated with fine-grained geo-entities, such as streets, stops and routes, as well as standard named entity types (organization, date, number, etc). All location-related entities have been linked to either Open Street Map identifiers or database ids of Deutsche Bahn / Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund. The corpus has also been annotated with a set of 8 traffic-related n-ary relations and events, such as Accidents, Traffic jams, and Canceled Routes. It consists of Twitter messages, and traffic reports from e.g. radio stations, police and public transport providers. It allows for training and evaluating both named entity recognition algorithms that aim for fine-grained typing of geo-entities, entity linking of these entities, as well as n-ary relation extraction systems."
