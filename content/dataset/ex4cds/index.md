title: Ex4CDS - Textual Explanations for Clinical Decision Support
summary: "Ex4CDS are explanations (or more precisely justifications) of physicians in the context of clinical decision support. In the course of a larger study, physicians estimated the probability of different clinical outcomes in nephology, namely rejection, graft loss and infections, within the next 90 days. Each estimation had to be justified within a short text - these are our explanations. The explanations were provided in German and have strong similarities to general clinical notes. You can find a description and the data here: https://github.com/DFKI-NLP/Ex4CDS"
