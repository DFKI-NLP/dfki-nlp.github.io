Hey!

I'm Lisa, a PhD candidate at both [Technical University Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). My supervisors are [Pierre Zweigenbaum](https://perso.limsi.fr/pz/) and [Sebastian Möller](https://www.tu.berlin/en/qu/about-us/management/), and I work closely with [Philippe Thomas](https://dfki-nlp.github.io/authors/philippe-thomas/) and [Roland Roller](https://dfki-nlp.github.io/authors/roland-roller/).
Currently, I am staying at [LISN](https://www.lisn.upsaclay.fr/) in France, after that I will move back to Berlin, Germany.

I am a [Computational Linguist](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/index) (Potsdam University) and received a MSc. in [Cognitive Systems](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/about.html) (also Potsdam).

My thesis is embedded in the trilateral project [KEEPHA](https://keepha.lisn.upsaclay.fr/wiki/doku.php?id=start) where I am researching the possibilities to detect and extract Adverse Drug Reactions across languages.

I am mostly interested in cross-lingual learning and NLP in health scenarios.
