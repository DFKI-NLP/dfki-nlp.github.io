I am a senior researcher and project manager in the Speech and Language Technology group at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). I focus on natural language processing and machine learning topics with a high interest in medical use cases. My work spans classical information extraction, anonymization, clinical decision support, chatbots and LLM agents. I work on various projects related to different medical domains, such as nephrology, emergency medicine, tumor boards, and sexual medicine. Here is the list of current projects: KIBATIN [KIBA](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/projects-and-publications/project/kibatin), PRIMA-AI, Medinym, ADBoard, SmartNTx, and Veranda. Please contact me if you are interested in our research, collaboration/supervision or would like to visit us.
