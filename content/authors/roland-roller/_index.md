I am a senior researcher and project manager in the Speech and Language Technology group at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). I focus on natural language processing and machine learning topics with a high interest in the medical domain. I am working on various topics, such as trustworthy clinical decision support, anonymization, information extraction, chat, and LLM agents. Currently, I am working on the research projects KIBATIN (AI-based assistance system for triaging in the emergency room), PRIMA-AI (Prospectively investigating the impact of AI on shared decision-making in post-kidney transplant care), Medinym (AI-based anonymization of personal patient data in clinical text and voice databases), ADBoard (Therapeutic Assistance and Decision Algorithms for Hepatobiliary Tumor Boards), SmartNTx (Interactive AI-based decision-making competence for transplant medicine), and Veranda (Trustworthy anonymization of sensitive patient data for remote consultations). Please contact me if you are interested in our research or collaboration/supervision.
