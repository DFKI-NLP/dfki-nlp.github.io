Three papers from DFKI-NLP authors have been accepted for publication at ACL 2022, the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. The conference is planned to be a hybrid meeting and will take place in Dublin, Ireland, from May 22nd through May 27th, 2022. One paper is on evaluating pre-trained encoders on the task of low-resource NER across several English and German datasets, the other analyzes relation classification evaluation and suggests that using F1 weightings other than micro-F1 tells us much more about model performance, e.g. on imbalanced datasets. The third paper proposs a novel approach to encode and inject hierarchical structure information explicitly into an extractive, transformer-based summarization model.
