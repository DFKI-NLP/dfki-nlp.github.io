Two papers from DFKI NLP researchers have been accepted at the [17th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2024)](https://inlg2024.github.io/) that will take place September 23-27 in Tokyo, Japan. One paper presents a case study on using large language models to produce customer-friendly help page contents from more technical text, and includes a text quality evaluation by experienced editors. The other paper analyzes echo chamber effects in LLM-based chatbots in political conversations.
