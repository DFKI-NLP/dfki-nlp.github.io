One paper from DFKI-NLP authors has been accepted for publication as a Findings paper at [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/), the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. The conference is planned to be a hybrid meeting and will take place in Singapore, from Dec 6th to Dec 10th, 2023. The paper introduces the InterroLang framework for dialog-based explanations of NLP models and datasets. It adapts the conversational explanation framework TalkToModel to the NLP domain, and add new NLP-specific operations such as free-text rationalizations."
