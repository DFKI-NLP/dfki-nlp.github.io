DFKI had a strong presence at the [2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2023)](https://2023.emnlp.org/), one of the top venues of language technology, that took place on December 6-10 in Singapore. The research center was represented by the departments [MLT](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology), [SLT](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology), and [DRΧ](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/design-research-explorations) with 11 papers, presented by 10 researchers. The papers appeared in the main conference as well as 3 co-located events: [“Conference for Machine Translation” (WMT)](http://www.statmt.org/wmt23/), [“Workshop on analyzing and interpreting neural networks for NLP” (BlackboxNLP)](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/), and [“Workshop on Computational Models of Reference, Anaphora and Coreference” (CRAC)](https://sites.google.com/view/crac2023/).  

Additionally, DFKI researchers contributed to the organization of the workshops by participating in the organization committees in 3 shared tasks and particularly the ones on Sign Language Translation, Generic Machine Translation and Machine Translation Metrics. Noteworthy is also the participation of the DFKI researchers in the program committees, where one researcher was an Area Chair in the Semantics track of the main conference, and numerous others contributed with peer-reviewing of submitted papers. The participation in the conference was supported by current research projects, as presentation of their recent results. Some of these projects were: CORA4NLP (BMBF), IMPRESS (INRIA-DFKI), SFB 1102 “Information Density and Linguistic Encoding” (DFG), SocialWear (BMBF), TextQ (DFG) and XAINES (BMBF).
