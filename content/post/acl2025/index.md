One paper by Qianli Wang and Nils Feldhus has been accepted to the Findings Track at the [63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2025 (ACL 2025)](https://2025.aclweb.org/). In the paper, they introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, they present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting.
