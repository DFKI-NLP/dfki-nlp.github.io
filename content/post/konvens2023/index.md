One paper from DFKI-NLP researchers has been accepted for publication at KONVENS 2023, the 19th German Conference on Natural Language Processing. The conference will take place in Ingolstadt, Germany, from Sep 18th to Sep 22nd, 2023. The paper presents an approach using machine translation to translate English data to German to train a transformer-based factuality detection model for clinical data, where supervised data is usually very scarce due to its sensitive nature and privacy concerns.
