DFKI will have a strong presence at the [62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2024)](https://2024.aclweb.org/), one of the top venues of language technology, that will take place August 11-16 in Bangkok, Thailand. Researchers from [Speech and Language Technology department](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) will present 6 papers. The papers appeared in the main conference (Findings) as well as 3 co-located events: [The 11th Workshop on Argument Mining](https://argmining-org.github.io/2024/), the [BioNLP 2024 and Shared Tasks Workshop](https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/BioNLP_Workshop), and the [Towards Knowledgeable Language Models Workshop](https://knowledgeable-lm.github.io/). 

The participation in the conference was supported by current research projects, as presentation of their recent results. Some of these projects were: TRAILS (BMBF), KEEPHA (BMBF), and XAINES (BMBF).
