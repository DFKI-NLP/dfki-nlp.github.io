The paper "Entity Linking using LLMs for Automated Product Carbon Footprint Estimation" has been accepted for presentation at the 1st Workshop on Ecology, Environment, and Natural Language Processing. This workshop, co-located with the Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa), takes place on the 2nd of March in Tallinn, Estonia. This paper presents a system for automated mapping of components from manufacturer bills of materials (BoMs) to a life cycle assessment (LCA) database in order to estimate product carbon emissions.
