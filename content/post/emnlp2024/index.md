One paper from researchers in the DFKI-NLP group has been accepted as a Findings paper at the [2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2024)](https://2024.emnlp.org/). EMNLP will take place November 12-16 in Miami, Florida. The paper presents CoXQL, a dataset for user intent recognition for conversational XAI systems, covering 31 intents, seven of which require filling multiple slots. The paper also presents an improved parsing approach for intent recognition and slot filling on this dataset, which is evaluated using different LLMs.
