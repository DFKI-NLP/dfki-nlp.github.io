    abstract = "Word vector representations, known as embeddings, are commonly used for natural language processing. Particularly, contextualized representations have been very successful recently. In this work, we analyze the impact of contextualized and non-contextualized embeddings for medical concept normalization, mapping clinical terms via a k-NN approach to SNOMED CT. The non-contextualized concept mapping resulted in a much better performance (F1-score = 0.853) than the contextualized representation (F1-score = 0.322)."
